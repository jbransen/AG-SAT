\begin{abstract}
Many computations over trees can be expressed using attribute
grammars. Compilers for attribute grammars need to find an evaluation
order (or schedule) in order to generate efficient code. For the class
of linear ordered attribute grammars such a schedule can be found
statically, but this problem is known to be NP-hard.

In this paper, we show how to encode linear ordered attribute grammar
scheduling as a SAT-problem. Cycle-freeness of the dependency graphs
is expressed by making the graphs chordal, which is a new approach for
encoding such graph property in SAT.

There are two main advantages to using a SAT-solver for scheduling:
(1) the scheduling algorithm runs much faster than existing scheduling
algorithms on real-world examples, and (2) by adding extra constraints
we obtain fine-grained control over the resulting schedule, thereby
enabling new scheduling optimizations.
